# Sheel_and_Pebbeles-Classification 🐚🪨

This project focuses on classifying **shells** and **pebbles** using deep learning and transfer learning techniques. The dataset consists of labeled images, and the classification task is approached with models that are trained, fine-tuned, and evaluated using accuracy and loss metrics.
